        question: "How fast can I start?",

    {
        question: "Is your process GDPR-compliant?",

    },
    {
        question: "Do I pay for interviews or candidate search?",
        answer: "Screening, matching, and interviews are completely free. You only pay once the developer is officially signed to your project."
    },
    {
        question: "What happens if the developer isn't a good fit?",
        answer: "You get a 2-week free trial period with every developer. If you're not satisfied, we provide a free replacement at no extra cost."

        question: "Can you provide a full team, not just one developer?",
        answer: "Yes. You can start with a single developer and later expand to a dedicated team with a tech lead. Scaling up or down is always flexible."
    },
    {
        question: "Will your developers work in my time zone?",
        answer: "Yes. Our developers are English-speaking, located in CET time zone, and experienced with European workflows."

    {
        question: "What types of projects do you support?",
        answer: "We've worked with FinTech, HealthTech, E-commerce, EdTech, PropTech, and SaaS companies. Our developers adapt quickly to different industries and processes."
